            <h2> Introduction</h2>
            <p> We all have 2 kidneys in our bodies near the <b>Spinal Cord</b>. Which is <b>bean shaped</b>. They are <b>reddish brown</b> organs. The size of a Kidney is about the size of your <b>fist(10-12cm)</b>

            Creatinine (From metabolic breakdown of creatine phosphate)<br>
            End products of HB metabolism<br>
            Metabolites of hormones <br>

        <h2> Kidney Disoders</h2>
        <p>Diseases that affect kidneys usually affect both kidneys.
            Causes accumulation of waste products and fluids causing severe uremia
            (kidney failure)

            <h3> Drug Therapy</h3>
            <p> Drug Therapy is nothing but using Medicines for patients.</p>

            <h3>Dialysis Therapy</h3>
            <p>Dialysis is a process that artificially removes metabolic wastes 
                from the blood in order to compensate for renal (kidney) failure</p>

                <h3> Kidney Transplantation</h3>
                <p>A kidney transplant is a surgery done to replace a diseased kidney with a healthy kidney from a donor. 
                    The kidney may come from a deceased organ donor or from a living donor.
